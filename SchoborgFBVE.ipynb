    "# Welcome to the Schoborg Fly Brain Volume Estimation Jupyter Notebook!\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Todd Schoborg is a professor in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Wyoming. He uses the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model organism to study particular genes involved in the control of brain growth. Mutations of these genes result in a small brain phenotype referred to as microcephaly. One useful metric in measuring the size of a fly's brain is its volume, which can be determined from micro-CT scans of the fly's head.\n",
    "\n",
    "The micro-CT scan of a fly’s head results in a stack of roughly 150 images that are taken at equal intervals while moving through the fly's head. Each pixel in each image represents a certain volume within that fly's head. The length and width of each pixel are the surface area on an image, and the depth of the pixel is equal to the gap between the images. Throughout his research, Todd has drawn thousands of hand-traced masks, in which each pixel is \"on\" if there is brain tissue in the pixel and \"off\" if there is not. Here are a few examples of slices from a single fly head, each of which contains brain tissue, and their corresponding hand-traced masks.\n",

    "\n",
    "These three images have about 20 images in between each of them, so the changes between each consecutive image are relatively gradual. This allows us to come up with a very good approximation of volume from a collection of masks. By taking the total count of pixels in the mask that are \"on\" (i.e., that correspond to brain tissue) and then multiplying that by the dimensions of each pixel, we can get a number that represents the volume of the brain in that slice. Then, by doing this for every slice that contains brain tissue and summing the volumes together, we can calculate the total brain volume for the fly. The image below demonstrates taking the volume of a slice that makes up a larger volume. There can be some small errors because each slice (represented in brown in the figure)  is extended for $\\Delta x$ without any change in width and height, but if there are enough slices, this method provides a very good approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='Images/Volume Cross Section.png' width=\"400\" height=\"400\">source: math24.net\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to automate this whole volume calculation process so that Todd does not have to devote a ton of time to manually tracing brain regions in more than 100 slices per fly. To automate this process, we used an image segmentation neural network that classifies each image in a scan as “brain”, or “not brain”. The network was trained using all of the flies that Todd drew masks for. The scans that were shown above are shown below, with the masks that were generated by the neural network.\n",

    "The scans are not perfect replicates of Todd’s hand-drawn masks, but they are good enough to get a pretty good approximation. They are precise, but not too accurate. The network tends to underestimate the brain region as compared to the hand-drawn scans, but it underestimates it at a pretty consistent rate. Plotting both sets of data resulted in a regression line with an $R^2$ value of $\\approx 0.97$. When the network used the training data, the average proportion of the generated volume relative to the actual volume was $\\approx 0.87$. If we multiply each predicted volume by $\\frac{1}{0.87}\\approx 1.15$, there is an average error of about $2.6\\%$. If this level of underestimation for the training data is consistent with the results from the new data, then we could get good estimates by multiplying each predicted volume by $1.15$. However, this is a big if, and I don't know what exactly is causing the underapproximation. All I can really say is that the masks the network produces for flies it has not seen before look accurate, so that leads me to think that volume estimations would be precise at the very least.\n"

Each of these fly type folders has around 5 individual fly folders in it. These individual folders are numbered with an underscore before the number, e.g. \"\\_02\". Within the individual folder, there are two tiff stacks. One of these has the scans, and one has the brain masks. Each has the same number of images in it, which are all in order. Some of the other images given were used in slightly different formats, which there are different functions for. I will explain those when I get to those functions. \n",

    "One of the issues that this network has is underestimating the volume. One solution Lars suggested for this is to replicate some the images with the largest absolute error in the training dataset. One of the things I output when I test the network on the training set is the index of the image with the largest error for each fly. Then, to replicate these images in the training dataset, we need both the mask and the scan from the index. To indicate whether we need the mask or the scan, there is the optional argument `getScan` with a default value of `False`. If the function is supplied the scan tif file, and we need the mask, or is it's supplied the mask file and we need the scan, then we find the other tif file in the current directory. This is assuming that in each folder for each fly follows the same format as the training data, where there are two tif stack files, one with scans and one with masks. If this is the case, then we just iterate through the directory, and once we find a file that is not hidden, and doesn't have the same name as the one we don't want, then we choose that file.\n",

It also returns a dictionary with a key of the name and type of the fly, and a value of the side dimension of the square image of the fly before it is scaled down to 256x256. This is a necessary value to have, because when calculating the brain volume of an image, the masks must be scaled back up to the original square resolution of the image so that each pixel takes up the area that it was intended to take up."

For each directory, if it's the first pass through the directory, which means we haven't processed either the scans or masks yet, so the `firstPass` variable is `True`. When first pass is true, we set `previousTotalImages` equal to `totalImages`, and then we run `convertImageHelper()` and return the result from that into `totalImages`. Then we get the difference between `totalImages` and `previousTotalImages` to get how many images the current fly contains, and store this in `firstPassImageCount`. \n",

We call `convertImageHelper()` and it assigns image IDs 151-305 to the images which are written to the `Masks/` folder in `parentDirectory`, which means that this second fly has 155 images. `convertImageHelper()` then returns total images, which is 455. In the current function, `imagePairID` is still `151` because it isn't returned from `convertImageHelper()`, it's only passed to it. We set `firstPass` to False, continue in the loop, and then process the scan file. We pass `totalImages=455` and `imagePairID=151` to `convertImageHelper()`, which processes the images in the tif scans file. That returns our new value for `totalImages`, which is hopefully `610`. We check that the images that were just processed from the scan file is equal to the images from the mask file, and then we increment `imagePairID` by `numberNewImages`, so `imagePairID` is now `306`."
